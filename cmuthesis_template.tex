% This is a template for a CMU thesis.  It is 16 pages without any content :-)
% The source for this is pulled from a variety of sources and people.
% Here's a partial list of people who may or may have not contributed:
%
%        bnoble   = Brian Noble
%        caruana  = Rich Caruana
%        colohan  = Chris Colohan
%        comar    = Cyrus Omar
%        dkoes    = David Koes
%        jab      = Justin Boyan
%        josullvn = Joseph O'Sullivan
%        jrs      = Jonathan Shewchuk
%        kosak    = Corey Kosak
%        mjz      = Matt Zekauskas (mattz@cs)
%        pdinda   = Peter Dinda
%        pfr      = Patrick Riley
%        rak      = Ryan Kavanagh

% dkoes: My main contribution is putting everything into a single class files and small template since I prefer this to some complicated sprawling directory tree with makefiles.

% rak: I ported it to use the "amsbook" class instead of the plain "book" class.

%% If you're versioning your thesis with Git (which you really should),
%% then the following lines will add a stamp at the bottom of each page
%% with the build time and current commit number. Very useful for
%% knowing which particular draft of your thesis your advisors or
%% committee members are talking about in their comments.
%%
%% See "Setup and tailoring" in the documentation for instructions on
%% how to set up the post-commit, post-merge, and post-checkout hooks
%% that generate the Git information used by the package:

%% Double space document for easy review:

% The other requirements Catherine has:
%
%  - avoid large margins.  She wants the thesis to use fewer pages,
%    especially if it requires colour printing.
%
%  - The thesis should be formatted for double-sided printing.  This
%    means that all chapters, acknowledgements, table of contents, etc.
%    should start on odd numbered (right facing) pages.
%
%  - You need to use the department standard tech report title page.  I
%    have tried to ensure that the title page here conforms to this
%    standard.
%
%  - Use a nice serif font, such as Times Roman.  Sans serif looks bad.
%
% Other than that, just make it look good...
